**Playground:** [CodePen](https://codepen.io/rafiulislamrafi/pen/dyjYMWR)

Create a progress bar using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

- Implement a progress/loading bar that animates from 0 to 100% in N seconds. (for example: 3 seconds)

  (Progress bar N starts animating with progress bar N-1 is done animating)

#### Instructions:

- No need to focus on responsiveness.
- No use of any library or framework.
- Code should be well structured with optimised solution.
- Code should easily accomodate new requirements and minimal changes.
